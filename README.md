Main objectives of the Assessment

Assignment
Given the case study, you are required to deliver a system proposal document and to structure the
data storage requirements using the appropriate data modelling techniques. More specifically, you
are required to complete the following tasks:

Task 1 - Select an appropriate system development methodology
In your report specify your role as a system analyst and the required skills throughout the SDLC.
Given current data process, select a suitable system development methodology (waterfall,
prototyping, RAD and etc.) to implement an information system. Justify your answer by comparing
your selected methodologies with more than two other methodologies.

Task 2 – Select one/two Data gathering technique
Page 5 of 11
Choose one or two data gathering technique to ascertain user needs for the new system. Examples

of data gathering techniques: interview, questionnaire, survey, observation or JAD.

Task 3 - Create a list of functional and non-functional requirements

Task 4 – Create Use cases

Draw a use case diagram for case study. Selecting two use cases, create use case description for
them.

Task 5 – Create Data Flow Diagram
Draw the context diagram, Level 0 DFD and Level 1 DFD for one identified use case in task 4.
Task 6 – Create Entity Relationship Diagram
Identify a list of entities and their attribute. Draw the corresponding ERD and the cardinality and
optionality which reflect the system requirements. Each relationship must have name, cardinality
and modality. Identify primary and foreign keys for each entity. Each primary key should be
underlined and each foreign key must be prefixed with an asterisk.
You should use an appropriate CASE tool to produce the diagram e.g. Microsoft Visio, Draw.io,
StarUML
Task 7 – Project Risk Management
Identify at least 1 risk which may occur during the completion of the system by using the RiskRegister template.
The diagrams must be completed using a CASE tool such as StarUML.
